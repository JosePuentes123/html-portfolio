<h1 style="color:turquoise">About Me</h1>
<p>First off let me just say how much I love programing
  Ever since I started to learn it I felt that programing 
  was going to turn out to be my passion. I am amazed 
  at how technology works and how with creativity so 
  many beautiful things can be created. Yet not just 
  great looking pages but also programs that are useful
  amd can be very helpful to make many tasks easier for people.</p>

<p>I am a very passionate person. When I find something 
  that I like, I invest a great deal of energy into that.
  I am also a fast learner. I can learn pretty much anything.
  I do have a great ability to concentrate on a task, and I 
  only feel a sense of accomplishment when the task is done.

<p>I love a job that is multi-dimensional. I really enjoy
  doing variable tasks in my work environment. This way
  I do not feel that the job is monotonous. I feel that staying 
  busy in a job such as that makes the work day seem very short.
  When I do something that I enjoy work feels like play and not
  like work. That's probably why it's been said, "Find a job that 
  you enjoy doing." Programing provides new challenges each 
  each new project you undertake. This would be an excellent 
  option for a job for me.</p>
